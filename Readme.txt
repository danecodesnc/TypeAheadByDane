Thanks so much for downloading my repo. Feel free to play around and see how this all works. Here's a description of what's created below.

A search-bar that I created to show order populations of the largest cities 
in each state within the United States in order from greatest to least, 
fetching information in JSON format. 
It also uses AJAX for real-time loading.
